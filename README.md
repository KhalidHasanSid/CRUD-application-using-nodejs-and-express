A basic password manager  where you can  able to store,update and delete your emails and passwords of your different social media and professional  accounts.<br>
This CRUD application  is developed on  different technologies.which I mentioned below:<br>
For frontend (user interface), I used HTML CSS, and Javascript.<br>
For backend  (server side scripting), I  used  Node.js and express.<br>
And for data storing and manipulation I used moongose, which is a  Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB.

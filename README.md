A basic password manager  where you can  store, update, and delete your emails and passwords of your different social media and professional  accounts.<br>
This CRUD application  is developed on  different technologies, which I mentioned below:<br>
For frontend (user interface), I used HTML CSS, and Javascript.<br>
For the backend  (server-side scripting), I  used  Node.js and Express.<br>
For data storing and manipulation I used Moongose, an  Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB.
